we understand that mass is attracted to the earth .. but why .	fukkin miracles violent j
we understand that mass is attracted to the earth .. but why .	the higgs field boson .
we understand that mass is attracted to the earth .. but why .	space time curve ?
we understand that mass is attracted to the earth .. but why .	gravitons ! theoretically ! ... no such particle found .. . and no solid theory for quantum gravity either ...
we understand that mass is attracted to the earth .. but why .	because objects follow geodesics ( basically the shortest local distance between two points ) and mass warps spacetime .
we understand that mass is attracted to the earth .. but why .	cuz it causes a bend in the space time blanket :)
we understand that mass is attracted to the earth .. but why .	because gravitons ( theoretical sub particles riding photons , as i understand it ) distort space !
we understand that mass is attracted to the earth .. but why .	because mass distorts space time and objects fall toward them .
we understand that mass is attracted to the earth .. but why .	matter and energy warp space time . the warping of space time affects how matter and energy move .
we understand that mass is attracted to the earth .. but why .	well , mass is attracted to mass . the earth just happens to have mass .
we understand that mass is attracted to the earth .. but why .	higgs boson
we understand that mass is attracted to the earth .. but why .	mass is attracted to mass ...
we understand that mass is attracted to the earth .. but why .	this could go into discussions of quantum gravity or space time , both being things we are really hand wavey in our knowledge haha
we understand that mass is attracted to the earth .. but why .	the reason is : combine massless spin two particles and 4 space time dimensions . voila ! gravity

does this mean that light also bends ( to a much lesser extent ) near planets and stars ? EOS absolutely . this phenomenon is called gravitational lensing .	a similar effect happens around the edges of razors , for different reasons

i took linear algebra after diff eq . is that not normal ?	did linear algebra , diff eq , and multivariable together .
i took linear algebra after diff eq . is that not normal ?	i took linear algebra before multivariable . my school uses linear to in multi .
i took linear algebra after diff eq . is that not normal ?	i think most schools treat vectomultivariable calc , diff eqs and linear algebra on the same level .
i took linear algebra after diff eq . is that not normal ?	no , i took linear after differential equations as well .
i took linear algebra after diff eq . is that not normal ?	realistically the only things from linear algebra you need in a differential equations course are a basic knowledge of matrices and knowing how to find eigenvalues eigenvectors

if we play our cards right , we will explore and populate the universe . in that case , evolution will end the human race .	this is what will happen . the odds of it not happening is infinitesimal and thusly negligible .

we will never be able to see atoms because they are smaller than the wavelength of visible light .	which is why we have electron microscopes .
